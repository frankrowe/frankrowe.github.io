  Maps that show a lot of data are cool. But try to show too many things at once and things get confusing. Recently I tried to help this problem this by creating a dynamic legend - a legend that only shows a layer if it has features visible in the current map view.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/legend.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p>
  For maps with just a few simple layers, this is pretty easy and something you can do on the client with a library like <a href="http://turfjs.org/static/docs/module-turf_intersect.html">turf-intersect</a>. But for this project, I had hundreds of complex layers covering most of the United States and Canada. I needed to come up with the fastest way possible to check every one of these layers for features in the current map view.
</p>
<p>
  This first thing I did was create a function that looped through every layer and ran a simple query to count the number of geometries that intersected the map's bounding box. I aggregated these results up and sent it back, where the client would hide a layer if there were zero intersecting geometries. This worked, but it was agonizingly slow. Every map pan caused a 20-30 second request to fire, usually not even finishing before you wanted to pan the map again.
</p>
<p>
  Three things needed to be done to make this legend faster:
  <ol>
    <li>Reduce the number of layers that needed to be checked.</li>
    <li>Reduce the number of queries that needed to be run for layers that did need to be checked.</li>
    <li>Make the query that checks for intersection as fast as possible.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  For step 1, I pre-calculated each layer's bounding box and sent that to the client on the initial map load. Now I could loop through and check if each layers' bbox intersected the map's. If it didn't intersect, I wouldn't have to go back to the server to check that layer. In many cases this reduced the number of layers to check by nearly half.
</p>
<p>
  For step 2, instead of looping and running an intersects query for each layer, I <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/queries-union.html">unioned</a> each query together. This eliminated all the overhead of starting and executing hundreds of queries on each map move.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I had to make the actual query as fast as possible. I realized that I didn't need to return the actual number of geometries that intersected, I just need a true or false. For some layers with 1M+ points and a large bounding box, counting was a big deal. Instead of selecting count(), I just selected "layerName" and added a limit of 1. Only the tables with intersecting geometries would be returned. The final query turned into something like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="sql">(select 'layerA' from schema.layerA where st_intersects(geom, st_geometryfromtext(bbox, 4326)) limit 1)
union
(select 'layerB' from schema.layerB where st_intersects(geom, st_geometryfromtext(bbox, 4326)) limit 1)
union
(select 'layerC' from schema.layerC where st_intersects(geom, st_geometryfromtext(bbox, 4326)) limit 1)
</code></pre>
<p>
  The legend now was pretty fast at responding on every map pan. The request was down to 2s instead of 20-30s previously. We now had a legend that always showed only what was needed, and a much more usable map.
</p>
<p>
  I am still trying to make this legend faster. If you have any ideas or a better way to do this, let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/fsrowe">twitter</a>.
