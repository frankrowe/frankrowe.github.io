<p>Today I pushed to master on <a href="http://esrgc.org">esrgc.org</a>, removing myself from the About page. It ends a five year long journey at the co-op. I learned so much in my time there, about programming and life in general. It was the perfect place to begin my career.</p>
<p>For now,  I'll continue freelancing in the geospatial field. I'm going to focus on creating and contributing to open source tools and the open source community. My goal moving forward is simple and has not changed: to work on software that people want to use.</p>
