<p><a href="http://www.ocearch.org/profile/mary_lee/">Mary Lee</a> is a 3,456 pound Great White that is tracked by the <a href="http://www.ocearch.org/">OCEARCH</a> team, and often approaches the shores of my hometown Ocean City, MD.</p>
<p>You can view her route over the last three years on ocreach.org, but I wanted to see how she traveled that path, from one ping to the next.</p>
<p>It's also interesting to use Esri's <a href="http://server.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Ocean/World_Ocean_Base/MapServer">World Ocean Base</a> as a base map to see when she moves into shallow and deep waters, and travels along ocean ridges.</p>
<p>Mary Lee's pings are always available from OCEARCH via a somewhat hidden <a href="http://www.ocearch.org/tracker/ajax/filter-sharks/?sharks%5B%5D=41&tracking-activity=+&gender=+&stage-of-life=+&location=0">API</a>.</p>
