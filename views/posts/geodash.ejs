<p>GeoDash is a minimal javascript chart library. It's built on <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> and supports horizontal and vertical bar charts, stacked bar charts, pie charts and line charts.</p>
<p>Why is it called GeoDash? Mostly because I built this while building "geodashboards" that usually involved a map. Also because using "geo" in anything makes it cool.</p>
